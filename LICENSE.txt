Altair Engineering Inc. - Data Analytics Software License Agreement 

THIS SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT") SETS FORTH THE STANDARD TERMS AND 
CONDITIONS FOR THE USE OF SOFTWARE AVAILABLE FROM ALTAIR AND WHICH IS ACCESSIBLE 
VIA PHYSICAL MEDIA, A LICENSE FILE, OR FROM AN ALTAIR OR THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE OR 
HOSTED COMPUTE RESOURCES.  THIS AGREEMENT SUPERSEDES ANY AND ALL PRIOR STANDARD 
TERMS AND CONDITONS FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF SUCH SOFTWARE.  BY CLICKING THE 
ACCEPTANCE BOX OR INSTALLING AND/OR USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ARE INDICATING YOUR 
(I) ACCEPTANCE OF THE FOLLOWING STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AND (II) AUTHORITY 
TO CONTRACTUALLY BIND THE PERSON OR ENTITY ON WHOSE BEHALF YOU HAVE DONE SO. IN 
THE EVENT THAT YOU OR YOUR EMPLOYER HAVE A CURRENT AND VALID NEGOTIATED 
LICENSE AGREEMENT ON FILE WITH ALTAIR ("MASTER AGREEMENT"), THEN SUCH MASTER 
AGREEMENT SHALL TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER THIS AGREEMENT.
This Data Analytics Software License Agreement is between ALTAIR ENGINEERING INC. or its authorized 
resellers ("Altair"), and you (the "Licensee"). Altair and Licensee, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as 
follows:  

1. LICENSE GRANT: Pursuant to this Data Analytics Software License Agreement (the "License Agreement"), 
Altair grants Licensee the following non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable, limited license rights to the 
software specified on the Altair Order Agreement or Quote (the "Quote"), in machine-readable object code form 
only, any installation routines including license key codes, and the technical specifications, user documentation and 
training materials associated therewith (the "Documentation") (collectively, the "Software"), subject to Licensee's 
payment of the license fees as set forth in the Quote and to the terms and conditions set forth herein. 

(a) Single Named User License. The Software is licensed to a single named user ("Single Named User") to be used 
by that individual only on a single physical or virtual computer (the "Computer"). The Single Named User License 
may be installed on a personal computer or workstation provided that the use of the Software is restricted to the 
Single Named User. The license for a named individual user can be installed on a network server if the 
corresponding network server license has been purchased. A separate license fee must be paid for each additional 
Computer on which the Software is used, and the Software may not be used on more Computers than the number of 
licenses listed on the Quote. Licensee may physically transfer the Software from one Computer to another in the 
licensed individual's possession and control, provided that Licensee removes all copies of the Software from the 
Computer from which the Software is being transferred. 

(b) Network License. If ordered as a Network License, the Network License can be installed on a network server for 
use only to allow client access to the Software on internal Computers. Each Computer that accesses the Software on 
the network server must have a separate software license (other than the user manager software). A license for the 
Software may not be shared or used concurrently on different servers. The number of CPUs contained in the server 
must be equal to or be less than the number of CPUs the software is licensed for on that server. 

(c) Subscription License. If ordered as a subscription license pursuant to an Quote, then Licensee may install and 
Use one copy of the Software or the number of copies of the Software specified in the Quote, provided, however, 
that Licensee's right to use the Software is time-limited to the term specified in the Quote. If Licensee does not 
purchase a term extension prior to the expiration of the then-current term, then at the end of such term this License 
Agreement (including any licenses granted hereunder) and the Quote shall be terminated pursuant to Section 7 
below and Licensee must abide by all provisions stated therein. 

(d) Units-enabled Subscription License. If ordered as a Units-enabled subscription license pursuant to a Quote, 
Licensee licenses a pool of Altair Units which allows Licensee to Use Units-enabled Software under Altair's LMS 
(defined below). When Units-enabled Software is invoked under Altair's LMS, the Units-enabled Software draws 
down a predetermined number of Altair Units from the pool of Altair Units licensed (as identified on the Quote).  
Licensee's right to use the Software is not perpetual and is time-limited to the term specified in the Quote. If 
Licensee does not purchase a term extension prior to the expiration of the then-current term, then at the end of such 
term this License Agreement (including any licenses and Units granted hereunder) and the Quote shall be terminated 
pursuant to Section 7 below and Licensee must abide by all provisions stated therein. For purposes of this License 
Agreement, "Altair's LMS" shall be defined as the license management system that accompanies the Software and 
limits its use in accordance with this License Agreement, and which includes a license log file which gathers and 
reports anonymized usage information of the Software which shall be made available to Altair automatically on no 
less than a monthly basis.

(e) "Use" and "Authorized User". For purposes of this License Agreement, "Use" means the processing of data for 
Licensee's internal operations and "Authorized User" means Licensee or any of Licensee's employees who have 
been granted access to the Software, as well as third-party consultants who use the Software on Licensee's behalf 
and have executed confidentiality agreements with Licensee that are at least as protective of Altair's confidential 
information as the provisions of this License Agreement, and have agreed to abide by all the terms and conditions of 
this License Agreement and the Quote. Licensee agrees that Licensee is responsible to Altair for all use of the 
Software by Authorized Users. 

(f) Restrictions. The license rights granted to Licensee under this License Agreement and the Quote are expressly 
conditioned upon Licensee's compliance at all times with the license restrictions set forth in this Section 1(f). 
Failure to comply with such restrictions shall be grounds for Altair to terminate this License Agreement and the 
Quote and Licensee's license rights hereunder immediately and without notice. Licensee shall not: 

(i) Use, print, display, publish, disclose, transmit, record, encumber by way of security interest or otherwise 
pledge or transfer, assign, distribute or make available the Software, except as expressly authorized herein. 
Any attempted transfer, assignment, encumbrance or pledge in violation of this License Agreement shall be 
void. 

(ii) Make any copies of all or any part of the Software except for the number of installations of the 
Software equal to the number of licenses purchased pursuant to the Quote, and up to one archival and 
backup copy of the Software. 

(iii) Modify, translate, adapt, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, incorporate the Software, in whole 
or in part, in any other product, or create derivative works based on the Software. If, notwithstanding the 
foregoing restrictions, Licensee makes any modifications, enhancements or derivative works to the 
Software, Licensee hereby assigns to Altair all rights, title, and interest in and to such modifications, 
enhancements, and/or derivative works. 

(iv) Use the Software to provide, or attempt to provide, any facility management, time sharing, service 
bureau, application hosting, application service provider (ASP), third party consulting service or other 
similar services, or to provide access to data to customers or other third parties. 

(v) Rent, lease, sell, lend, license or sublicense the Software to a third party or operate the software for the 
benefit of a third party, including in the provision of consulting services for third party clients. Any 
attempted rental, lease, sale, license or sublicense in violation of this License Agreement shall be void. 

(vi) Remove any copyright, patent, trademark, proprietary rights, disclaimer or warning notice included on 
or embedded in any part of the Software or any copy of the Software. 

(vii) Use software or hardware to reduce the number of users directly accessing or using the Software 
(sometimes called "multiplexing" or "pooling" software or hardware). Multiplexing or pooling does not 
reduce the number of Software licenses required. Licensee must purchase the number of client licenses 
equal to the number of distinct user inputs to the front end of the multiplexing or pooling software or 
hardware. 

(viii) Export the Software for the purposes of directly populating or loading any database or database 
management system for other than personal use. 

(ix) Use the Software as part of any automated process developed using scripting, APIs or other 
programmatic methods. 

(x) Permit others (including Authorized Users) to do any of the foregoing. 

(g) Audit. Licensee agrees to allow Altair or its agent to inspect or conduct an independent audit from time to time 
on Licensee's use of the Software to verify Licensee's compliance with this License Agreement and the Quote. In 
the event that any audit reveals an underpayment by Licensee of more than five percent (5%) of the amounts due 
Altair in the period being audited, or that Licensee has breached any term of this License Agreement or Quote, then, 
in addition to any other remedies Altair may have, Licensee will promptly pay to Altair any underpayments and the 
cost of the audit and correct any non-compliance. 

2. MAINTENANCE: If Licensee has purchased a maintenance contract on the Quote, Altair will provide Licensee 
with the following services ("Maintenance"): (1) telephone or email support from Monday through Friday during 
Altair's normal business hours, except public holidays; (2) supply of maintenance releases of the Software as 
described below; and (3) notification of product problems and solutions. Maintenance is available for the current 
Software version and the prior version. Provided that Licensee's Maintenance is not lapsed, Altair agrees to provide 
Licensee, free of charge, with such maintenance releases,bug fixes, corrections, enhancements, updates and new 
releases to the Software (other than those independently priced and licensed) as Altair may release (collectively 
"Updates"). All Updates and upgrades shall be considered part of the Software for purposes of the License 
Agreement and shall be governed by all the same terms and conditions of this License Agreement and the Quote as 
are applicable to the Software. To reinstate lapsed Maintenance, Licensee may be required to pay Maintenance fees 
for the full lapsed period plus the annual period going forward from the renewal date (at the maintenance price 
current at the time of the reinstatement), in addition to a reinstatement fee. Maintenance that lapses for more than six 
(6) months is not eligible for reinstatement.  Altair shall have no obligation to maintain or support (a) altered, 
damaged or Licensee-modified Software, or any portion of the Software incorporated with or into other software not 
provided by Altair; (b) any version of the Software other than the current version of the Software or the immediately 
prior release of the Software; (c) problems caused by Licensee's negligence, abuse or misapplication of Software 
other than as specified in the Documentation, or other causes beyond the reasonable control of Altair; or (d) 
Software installed on any hardware, operating system version or network environment that is not supported by 
Altair. Maintenance also excludes configuration of hardware, non-Altair Software, and networking services; 
consulting services; general solution provider related services; and general computer system maintenance.

3. OWNERSHIP: Licensee acknowledges and agree that Altair and its suppliers maintain exclusive ownership of all 
right, title and interest in and to the Software, in all forms and all copies thereof including, without limitation, any 
and all worldwide copyrights, patents, trade secrets, trademarks, and proprietary and confidential information rights 
associated with the Software. Licensee agrees to reproduce and include the copyright notices on any copies of the 
Software which Licensee are permitted to make. The Software is protected by US copyright laws and international 
copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. This is a license, not a sale of the Software 
or any copy of it, nor is it a waiver of any intellectual property rights of Altair. Licensee acknowledges and agrees 
that nothing in this License Agreement or the Quote gives Licensee any right, title or interest in or to the Software 
except for the limited express rights granted pursuant to Section 1 of this License Agreement. All rights not 
expressly granted herein shall be reserved to Altair. No implied licenses are granted hereunder. 

4. DELIVERY: Altair shall deliver the Software set forth on the Quote via electronic delivery to the address set 
forth on the Quote, or, if electronic delivery is somehow not practicable in Altair's judgment, then FOB shipping 
point. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the Software will be delivered on media containing, together, one 
copy of the Software and one copy of such user manuals and other printed material which may be included with the 
Software. Licensee assumes all risk of loss, damage or destruction of the Software after receipt of the Software. 

5. PAYMENT: License and Maintenance Fees are billed according to the schedule outlined in the Quote. Invoices 
shall be paid by Licensee within thirty (30) days of receipt. Any late payments to Altair will accrue interest at the 
lesser of (i) eighteen percent (18%) per annum and (ii) the maximum interest allowable by law. Licensee must notify 
Altair in writing within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice of any disputed amounts and must pay all undisputed 
amounts in full when due. Licensee shall be responsible for all reasonable costs incurred by Altair in connection 
with collecting amounts past due, including without limitation, attorney and collection fees. All fees and expenses 
are exclusive of any national, state, municipal, or other governmental excise, sales, value-added and occupational 
taxes and other fees and levies, all of which Licensee shall be responsible for and will pay in full, other than taxes 
based on Altair's net income. 

6. CONFIDENTIALITY: Licensee acknowledges and agrees that the Software is confidential information of Altair 
and that it constitutes valuable proprietary information and trade secrets of Altair. Accordingly, Licensee agrees to 
use the Software only in accordance with the terms and conditions of this License Agreement and to implement 
commercially reasonable procedures to prevent other persons from obtaining access to or use of the Software 
without Licensee's knowledge and Altair's prior express written permission. 

7. TERMINATION: 

(a) Termination by Licensee. Licensee may terminate this License Agreement and related licenses at any time by 
destroying the Software, together with all copies in any form, and providing Altair with written notice of termination 
and certifying such destruction. In the event of any such termination, Licensee agrees that any pre-paid fees are non-
refundable. If the Quote provides for ongoing payments during a specified term, or Licensee has not paid all fees 
due and Licensee terminates prior to the end of such term, Licensee agrees to pay the full amount that has or would 
have become due during such term, and such payment shall be due in full upon termination. 

(b) Termination by Altair. Without prejudice to any other rights, Altair may terminate this License Agreement and 
the Quote immediately upon written notice to Licensee if Licensee fails to comply with any of the terms and 
conditions of this License Agreement (including without limitation any violation of the restrictions set forth in 
Section 1(f) or the failure to pay any amounts owed by Licensee to Altair pursuant to this License Agreement or the 
Quote), or in the event that Licensee ceases its business operations, makes a general assignment for the benefit of 
creditors, is adjudged bankrupt, or becomes insolvent. 

(c) Effect of Termination or Expiration. Upon termination of this License Agreement for whatever reason, all 
Quotes regarding Licensee's use of the Software, and all licenses granted hereunder and there under, shall be 
immediately terminated. Within 15 days following the effective date of such termination or expiration, Licensee 
must return to Altair or destroy all copies of the Software and all of its component parts and delete or otherwise 
remove the Software from any computer hardware on which it was installed, and promptly certify in writing to 
Altair that the same have been returned or destroyed. Termination of this License Agreement or the Quote shall not 
relieve either party of any payment or other obligation under this License Agreement or the Quote which was to 
have been performed by such party prior to termination. Sections 1(f), 1(g), 3, 5, 6, 7(c), 8(b), 8(c) and 10-17 of this 
License Agreement shall survive the termination or expiration of this License Agreement. 

8. LIMITED WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: 

(a) Altair warrants solely that, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of Licensee's receipt of the Software, (i) 
the Software will function substantially in accordance with published specifications on the date of delivery to 
Licensee provided that Licensee uses the Software in accordance with this License Agreement, the Documentation, 
and as otherwise directed by Altair; and (ii) the media on which the Software is distributed are free from defects in 
materials and in workmanship. This warranty does not apply if: (1) the Software has been altered or modified, (2) 
the Software has not been installed, operated, repaired or maintained in accordance with the Documentation, (3) the 
Software has been subjected to abnormal physical or electrical stress, misuse, negligence or accident, (4) the version 
of the Software used does not include all Updates available from Altair, or (5) the defect or error was caused by 
third-party hardware or software malfunctions or software provided by a third party and included in the Software 
("Third Party Software"), or failure or by acts or omissions caused by persons other than Altair. Provided that 
Licensee gives notice of return to Altair within such 30-day period and that Licensee returns the Software no later 
than ten days after the expiration of such 30-day period, a copy of this License Agreement and the Quote and a 
written statement specifying in reasonable detail the nature of the claimed non-conformance or defect then, as 
Licensee's exclusive remedy and as Altair's entire liability, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, for non-
conformity with the foregoing limited warranty, Altair will, at its discretion, do one of the following: (a) use 
reasonable commercial efforts to correct the non-conformance or defect of the Software; (b) replace the Software at 
no additional charge; or (c) refund the license fee and terminate Licensee's license to Use the Software. Altair does 
not warrant that the Software will meet Licensee's requirements or that the operation of the Software, or any Third-
Party Software, will be uninterrupted or error free. No oral or written information given by Altair, its agents, or 
employees shall create a warranty. The limited warranty provided in this Section 8(a) gives Licensee specific legal 
rights and Licensee may also have other rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Provided that Licensee 
uses the Software as made available by Altair in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Altair hereby 
represents that no open source Third Party Software included in the Software will require Licensee to disclose any 
Licensee source code.  

(b) EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 8(a) ABOVE, ALTAIR DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER 
WARRANTIES, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE (REGARDLESS OF ANY KNOWLEDGE OF LICENSEE'S PARTICULAR NEEDS) 
AND THOSE ARISING BY STATUTE OR OTHERWISE IN LAW OR FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR 
USAGE OF TRADE. IF IMPLIED WARRANTIES MAY NOT BE DISCLAIMED BY APPLICABLE LAW, 
THEN ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO 30 DAYS AFTER RECEIPT OF 
THE SOFTWARE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED 
WARRANTY LASTS SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY. Licensee assumes full responsibility 
for the selection of the Software to achieve Licensee's intended results and for the installation, use, and results 
obtained from the Software, including but not limited to providing a suitable system for installation, providing the 
appropriate environment for operating the Software and loading Licensee's data. Due to the inherent complexity of 
computer software, Licensee is advised to verify its work. 

(c) ALTAIR'S CUMULATIVE LIABILITY IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF OR IN 
CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE, OR ALTAIR'S AGREEMENT WITH LICENSEE, SHALL NOT 
EXCEED THE LICENSE FEES PAID BY LICENSEE FOR THE SOFTWARE IN THE PRECEDING TWELVE 
MONTHS. IN NO EVENT SHALL ALTAIR OR ITS DEVELOPERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, 
AFFILIATES OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, 
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOSS 
OF USE, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF SAVINGS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR OTHER 
ECONOMIC LOSS). THE FOREGOING LIMITATION SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF 
ACTION UNDER WHICH DAMAGES ARE SOUGHT AND EVEN IF ALTAIR OR A REPRESENTATIVE OF 
ALTAIR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

IF APPLICABLE LAW RESTRICTS THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN TYPES OF 
DAMAGES, THEN THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS SHALL BE DEEMED TO EXCLUDE AND LIMIT 
ALTAIR'S LIABILITY FOR ANY SUCH DAMAGES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 

Licensee acknowledges that Altair has established the license fee for the Software based on the limitations contained 
in this Section 8 and Licensee has agreed to the license fee paid based in part upon Licensee's agreement with and 
acceptance of the terms of this Section 8. 

9. INDEMNIFICATION: 

(a) Indemnity. Altair shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Licensee and Licensee's directors, officers, agents, 
Authorized Users, and employees (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses, damages, liabilities, 
costs, and expenses (including but not limited to attorneys' fees) resulting from any action, suit, claim, demand, or 
proceeding, that the Software or Use thereof infringes or misappropriates any United States patent, copyright or 
trademark of any third party. The foregoing shall not apply unless the Indemnified Parties (i) inform Altair as soon 
as practicable of the suit or action alleging such infringement, (ii) allow Altair to control the defense of such suit or 
action and any related negotiations or settlement, and (iii) cooperate with Altair in such defense or settlement. 

(b) Limitations. If the Software is held to infringe or is believed by Altair to possibly infringe, Altair shall have the 
option, at its expense, to (i) modify the Software to be non-infringing; or (ii) obtain for Licensee a license to 
continue using the Software. If Altair determines it is not commercially reasonable to perform either of the above 
options, then Altair may at its option elect to terminate the license for the Software and refund the fees paid to Altair 
by Licensee for the Software on a monthly amortization basis including only the period for which the specific 
license was granted. THIS SECTION STATES LICENSEE'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR 
INFRINGEMENT OR CLAIMS ALLEGING INFRINGEMENT. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
License Agreement, Altair assumes no liability, and shall have no liability, for any claims or allegations of 
infringement with respect to the Software, or any software in or with which the Software may be used, based on: (1) 
an Indemnified Party's use of the Software after Altair's notice to cease use of the Software due to a claim or 
allegation of infringement; (2) any modification of the Software by an Indemnified Party or pursuant to Licensee's 
provided specifications; (3) an Indemnified Party's combination of Software with non-Altair Software, data, 
hardware, or other materials, if such infringement claim would have been avoided by the exclusive use of the 
Software alone; (4) Third Party Software; (5) Use of the Software that does not include all Updates available from 
Altair if such Update is necessary to avoid infringement; (6) any trademark or trade name infringement involving 
any marking or branding of an Indemnified Party; or (7) use of any Software licensed pursuant to Section 1(f) of this 
License Agreement. 

10. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION: This License Agreement and the Quote shall be governed, 
interpreted, and enforced by the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding Delaware's choice of law principles, and 
all claims relating to or arising out of this License Agreement, or the breach thereof, whether sounding in contract, 
tort or otherwise, shall likewise be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding Delaware's choice of 
law principles, except if the State of Delaware adopts the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act drafted 
by the National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform State Laws as revised or amended as of June 30, 2002 
("UCITA") which is specifically excluded. In the event that an action or claim arises outside of the exclusive 
jurisdiction specified herein which names Altair as a party, Altair and Licensee specifically agree to initiate, consent 
to and/or cooperate with any and all efforts to remove the matter to the exclusive jurisdiction named herein, or 
otherwise take any and all reasonable actions to achieve the objectives of this provision. The parties hereby exclude 
the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer 
Information Transactions Act from this License Agreement and the Quote. Each party waives its right to a jury trial 
in the event of any dispute arising under or relating to this License Agreement. No action, regardless of form, arising 
out of the transactions under this Agreement may be brought by either party against the other more than two (2) 
years after the cause of action has accrued, except for actions related to unpaid fees.

11. TRANSFER OF LICENSE: Licensee may not transfer or assign this License Agreement or the Quote, any 
licenses granted hereunder or all or a portion of the Software to any third party. Altair may freely assign this License 
Agreement and the Quote in whole or in part. 

12. ENTIRE AGREEMENT: This License Agreement and the Quote, if applicable, together constitute the entire 
agreement and understanding of the parties and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements, 
understandings, negotiations and proposals, oral or written, including any shrink wrap license agreement included 
with the Software, and any other or different terms or conditions in any purchase orders, Licensee's websites 
(including any terms or conditions subject to an accept button or similar means of indicating acceptance) or other 
documents will be deemed null and void. Except for: (i) the incorporation by reference to this License Agreement or 
the actual attachment of this License Agreement, or (ii) any terms on an Altair issued invoice pertaining to price, 
quantity, Software product; no other terms (pre-printed, on the front or back of any Licensee PO, or incorporated by 
reference) on Licensee's purchase order shall apply. This License Agreement and the Quote may be amended or 
modified only by a subsequent agreement in writing signed by each of the parties and may not be modified by 
course of conduct or the terms of any purchase order or sales invoice. The waiver by either party of a breach of a 
term or condition of this License Agreement or the Quote must be in writing and will not be construed as a waiver of 
any subsequent breach of such term or condition or the waiver of the provision itself. A party's performance after 
the other party's breach shall not be construed as a waiver of that breach. In the event of any conflict between the 
terms of this License Agreement and those of the Quote, the terms of the Quote shall govern with respect to the 
subject matter of such conflicting terms. 

13. SEVERABILITY: In the event any provision of this License Agreement or the Quote is found to be invalid, 
illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of any of the remaining provisions shall not in any 
way be affected or impaired thereby, and that provision shall be reformed, construed and enforced to the maximum 
extent permissible, provided that this License Agreement and the Quote shall not then substantially deprive either 
party of the bargained-for performance of the other party. Any such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability in any 
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render illegal or unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. 

14. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS: This section applies to all acquisitions of the Products by or for 
the United States federal government.  By accepting delivery of the Products, the Licensee hereby agrees that the 
Products qualify as "commercial computer software" as that term is defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation 
(FAR) 2.101 and Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) clause 252.227-7014(a)(1), as applicable, and 
the Government shall have only the rights in the Products specified in this Agreement in accordance with FAR 
12.212 and DFARS 227.7202-3(a), as applicable.  This Agreement supersedes any contrary terms or conditions, 
including, without limitation, any noncommercial computer software FAR, DFARS, or other FAR agency 
supplemental clauses contained in any purchase order, statement of work, contract, or other document.  If any 
provision of this Agreement is unacceptable to the government, Altair may be contacted at Altair Engineering, Inc., 
1820 E. Big Beaver Road, Troy, MI 48083-2031; telephone (248) 614-2400.  If any provision of this Agreement 
violates applicable federal law or does not meet the government's actual, minimum needs, the Licensee agrees to 
return the Products for a full refund. 

15. EXPORT LAWS: None of the Software or underlying information or technology may be downloaded or 
otherwise exported or re-exported (i) into (or to a national or resident of) any country to which the U.S. has 
embargoed goods; or (ii) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the 
U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Denial Orders. By downloading or using the Software, Licensee agrees to 
the foregoing and represents and warrants that Licensee is not located in, under the control of, or a national or 
resident of any such country or on any such list. In addition, Licensee agrees to comply with all relevant export laws 
and regulations of the United States and any local laws in Licensee's jurisdiction that may impact Licensee's right to 
import, export or use the Software, and represents that Licensee has complied with any regulations or registration 
procedures required by applicable law to make this license enforceable. 

16. REMEDIES: Licensee acknowledges the uniqueness of the Software and agrees that a breach of this License 
Agreement by Licensee could cause Altair irreparable harm for which money damages may not be adequate, and 
that Altair shall therefore be entitled to obtain, in addition to any other rights of recovery Altair may be entitled to 
pursue at law or in equity, timely injunctive relief to protect Altair's rights under this License Agreement without the 
necessity of posting a bond. Any such relief will be in addition to and not in lieu of any appropriate relief in the way 
of monetary damages as may be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction. 

17. U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT; ANTI-BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION: The parties agree to 
comply with, and not to perform any act that would subject the other party to sanctions under the U.S. Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act and/or all applicable international anti-bribery and corruption laws, regulations, and orders. In 
particular, the parties agree that in connection with, or in the performance of this License Agreement, a party will 
not make or promise to make any payment (whether in currency, property or other thing of value) to any third 
person, firm or entity (including, without limitation, any government official or representative) for the purpose of 
obtaining or retaining business. Each party agrees that it does not desire and will not request any service or action by 
the other party that would or might constitute a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and/or any applicable 
international anti-bribery and corruption laws, regulations and orders, including but not limited to the UK Bribery 
Act. 

18. GENERAL: The terms, representations, warranties and agreements of the parties set forth in this License 
Agreement are not intended for, nor shall they be for the benefit of or enforceable by, any third party. This License 
Agreement and any Quote may be executed in two or more counterparts and by PDF, each of which shall be deemed 
to be an original for all purposes hereof. Notice under this License Agreement shall be in writing and may be by 
overnight mail, in person, or by electronic mail and shall be deemed served when delivered. 

19. PROFESSIONAL SERVICES: Altair may make available to Licensee project management, consulting, training 
and implementation services (collectively, "Professional Services") as indicated in an Quote or as otherwise 
mutually agreed. Such Professional Services are available to assist Licensee, under Licensee's direction and at 
Licensee's responsibility, in the implementation of the Software or in various post-implementation projects or tasks 
that may occur from time to time. Professional Services shall be made available at Altair's prevailing rates. If 
Professional Services are included in the Quote, Altair shall make commercially reasonable efforts to schedule such 
Professional Services in accordance with Licensee's request. When Altair does schedule an appointment 
("Appointment") for the commencement of one or more such Professional Services and Licensee, at Licensee's own 
volition for whatever reason, postpone or cancel such Appointment within five working days of the Appointment 
date, Altair may, at its discretion, invoke a charge for breaking the Appointment equal to 100% of the normal billing 
rate for such services which would have commenced at the time of the Appointment. If Licensee breaks an 
Appointment between six and ten working days prior to such an Appointment, Altair may, at its discretion, invoke a
